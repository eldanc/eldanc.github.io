	abstract = {In the recent years, there has been significant work on the difficulty of heuristic search problems, identifying different problem instance characteristics that can have a significant impact on search effort. Phase transitions in the solubility of random problem instances have proved useful in the study of problem difficulty for other classes of computational problems, notably SAT and CSP, and it has been shown that the hardest problems typically occur during this rapid transition. In this work, we perform the first empirical investigation of the phase transition phenomena for heuristic search. We establish the existence of a rapid transition in the solubility of an abstract model of heuristic search problems and show that, for greedy best first search, the hardest instances are associated with the phase transition region. We then perform a novel investigation of the behavior of heuristics of different strength across the solubility spectrum. Finally, we demonstrate that the behavior of our abstract model carries over to commonly used benchmark problems including the Pancake Problem, Grid Navigation, TopSpin, and the Towers of Hanoi. An interesting deviation is observed and explained in the Sliding Puzzle.},

	year = {2018},
	abstract = {In this work, we study the runtime distribution of satisficing planning in ensembles of random planning problems and in multiple runs of a randomized heuristic search on a single planning instance. Using common heuristic functions (such as FF) and six benchmark problem domains from the IPC, we find a heavy-tailed behavior, similar to that found in CSP and SAT. We investigate two notions of constrainedness, often used in the modeling of planning problems, and show that the heavy-tailed behavior tends to appear in relatively relaxed problems, where the required effort is, on average, low. Finally, we show that as with randomized restarts in CSP and SAT solving, recent search enhancements that incorporate randomness in the search process can help mitigate the effect of the heavy tail.},

	title={Cost-based Heuristics and Node Re-Expansions Across the Phase Transition},
	booktitle = {International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS)},
	pages     = {11--19},
	year = {2017},
	abstract = {Recent work aimed at developing a deeper understanding of suboptimal heuristic search has demonstrated that the use of a cost-based heuristic function in the presence of large operator cost ratio and the decision to allow re-opening of visited nodes can have a significant effect on search effort. In parallel research, phase transitions in problem solubility have proved useful in the study of problem difficulty for many computational problems and have recently been shown to exist in heuristic search problems. In this paper, we show that the impact on search effort associated with a larger operator cost ratio and the number of node re-expansions is concentrated almost entirely in the phase transition region. Combined with previous work connecting local minima in the search space with such behavior, these observations lead us to hypothesize a relationship between the phase transition and the existence of local minima.},
